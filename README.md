# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Result Summary Component

This project is about building a simple result summary component that responsive for mobile and desktop view. In this challenge, I use only html and sass. The sass file then compiled with Live Sass Compiler extension in VS code. For the stylesheet architecture, i choose BEM approach so the css code can be neatly organized.
